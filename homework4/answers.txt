These questions are for Part 2 and assume that you've finished implementing and running analysis.py.

1. What happened to all the centroids? Why are there fewer than the 12 initial centroids?
Answer:
    I observed that for initial centroid, there is 12 centroids (centroid 0 to centroid 11)
 However, the final only generated 11 centroids (centroid 1 to centroid 11). 
 I am guessing that the data points that I am given only had 11 clusters but we are given 12 centroids.
 In def main(data, init_centroids, dataset) in kmeans.py file, and in the "while loop" on line 224
 it uses "assign points to centroids" and "update centroids" function to converge the data points into given centroids.
 Those two functions, required not to print any centroid for final if there were no data point converging into the centroid.
 For example, if I have 2 centroids - centroid 1 and centroid 2, and all my data points were clustered into centroid 1,
 the "assign points to centroids" function and "update centroids" function will only work on centroid 1, and will not use centroid 2.
    So, for our initial centroids (from 0 to 11), centroid 0 did not even have data points clustered into itself to begin with. 
    Therefore, our algorithm omitted centroid 0 for our final outcome, which means that one centroid may not have data points assigned to it 


2. What's the accuracy of the algorithm for the MNIST dataset? By looking at the
centroids, which letters are easier to be distinguished by the algorithm,
and which are harder?
Answer: 
The accuracy of the algorithm for the MNIST dataset is 0.604.
Letters that are easier to be distinguished by the algorithm: 
    M, W, S, O
Letters that are harder to be distinguished by the algorithm:
    I think any letter with below 0.5 accuracy, is harder to be distinguished by the algorithm. 
So, centroid 6 (letter O), centroid 9 (letter P), centroid 4 (letter V), centroid 11 (letter S), and centroid 8 (letter V).
It also seems like centroid 11 and 8 were especially hard to analyze.
