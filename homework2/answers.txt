Homework 2

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file and your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

a: In the for loop at line 111, there is a variable called "gc_count" 
where it adds 1 to its value whenever there is G or C in the DNA. 
If "gc_count = 0" gets commented out,the dna_analysis.py file doesn't
recognize the line as a code anymore. So, there is no variable to assign
what gc_count is as gc_count is not defined, and therefore dna_analysis.py 
file has an error because it can't run the for loop. 

b: If we commented "nucleotides = filename_to_string(file_name)" out, the 
code wouldn't be able to read DNA sequence data and assign it into a variable
called "nucleotides." If that happens, the for loop wouldn't be able to run, as
nucleotides isn't an assigned value.

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.4302926296296296
AT-content: 0.5689938518518518

Problem 3:

G count: 5738773
C count: 5879128
A count: 7701287
T count: 7661547

Problem 4:

sample_1.fastq
sample_2.fastq
sample_3.fastq
sample_4.fastq
sample_5.fastq
sample_6.fastq
test-high-gc-1.fastq
test-high-gc-2.fastq
test-moderate-gc-1.fastq
test-moderate-gc-2.fastq

I think it is because there are some white spaces,
meaning that there are some 'spaces' on the DNA sequences
that counted as a letter and was added to Total count and
Length of nucleotides as both values only counts how many
characters are in the DNA data, without checking if the character
actually is one of G,C,A, or T. Since Sum of G+C+A+T verifies
what is calculated is actually a nucleotide - the character 
is for sure G,C,A, or T - it eliminates the spaces. Therefore,
'Sum of G+C+A+T counts' value is different than 'Total count'
and 'Length of nucleotides.'

I think the quantity 'Sum of G+C+A+T counts' should be used
as a denominator, but 'Total count' and 'Length of nucleotides'
shouldn't be used as denominator. This is because only
'Sum of G+C+A+T counts' value accurately evaluates 'A+C+G+T'
because it only takes the sum of A+C+G+T like we need. However,
'Total count' and 'Length of nucleotides' adds white spaces that
isn't A,C,G, nor T into its value, so it is inaccurate representation
of the data.
